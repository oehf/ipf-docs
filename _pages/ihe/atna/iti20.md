# ATNA ITI-20 Support

IPF Camel components are able to send audit records out-of-the box, and allow a flexible configuration
of this mechanism, as described in the [corresponding section][ATNA auditing].
Detailed configuration instructions are given [here][DICOM auditng], as well as
[here][Spring Boot ATNA] for Spring Boot applications.
